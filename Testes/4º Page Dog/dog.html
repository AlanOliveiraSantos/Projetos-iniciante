                One benefit of home training is that it is private — you and your trainer can focus on things you particularly want your dog to learn, while at group classes you may spend time on things you don’t personally find important

                Home training may allow you and your dog to focus more on each other. Group class training helps your dog learn to focus, even when there are distractions from other dogs.
